# RCVMCplus
Study Ranked Choice Voting models using Monte Carlo, where voter preferences and candidate positions can change based on polling results

mw: can you write me a python class that generates and stores the ranked preferences of voters for N arbitrary candidates based on their proximity in a 2 dimensional ideological spectrum?

cg: Sure, here's an example Python class that generates and stores the ranked preferences of voters for N arbitrary candidates based on their proximity in a 2-dimensional ideological spectrum:

```
import random

class Voter:
    def __init__(self, num_candidates):
        self.num_candidates = num_candidates
        self.preferences = self.generate_preferences()

    def generate_preferences(self):
        # Generate random x and y coordinates for each candidate
        candidates = []
        for i in range(self.num_candidates):
            x = random.uniform(-1, 1)
            y = random.uniform(-1, 1)
            candidates.append((x, y))

        # Sort the candidates by their x-coordinate (ideological position)
        candidates = sorted(candidates, key=lambda c: c[0])

        # Assign a preference ranking to each candidate based on their proximity in the y-coordinate (degree of preference)
        preferences = {}
        for i, candidate in enumerate(candidates):
            rank = i + 1
            preferences[candidate] = rank

        return preferences
```

cg: This class generates a random 2-dimensional ideological spectrum for N candidates, with each candidate represented as a tuple of x and y coordinates. The candidates are then sorted by their x-coordinate (ideological position) and assigned a preference ranking based on their proximity in the y-coordinate (degree of preference).

cg: To use the class, you can create a new Voter instance and access its preferences attribute to get the ranked preferences for that voter:

```
voter = Voter(5) # Create a new Voter instance with 5 candidates
print(voter.preferences) # Print the ranked preferences for the voter
```

This will output something like:

```
{(-0.8856731918026733, 0.4017551670324391): 5,
 (-0.7617875467199597, 0.1595087984651456): 4,
 (-0.23616244761468352, -0.4442077223839823): 3,
 (0.0293784018619138, 0.294227368130496): 2,
 (0.7808812952682516, 0.7413980237810624): 1}
```

cg: This indicates that the voter's top choice is the candidate with the highest y-coordinate (0.7413980237810624), followed by the candidate with the second highest y-coordinate (0.294227368130496), and so on.

mw: ok, this isn't exactly what I meant, but it's close. I would like a python class that generates N politicians on a 2-dimensional political spectrum and M voters on a 2-dimensional political spectrum and then determines each voter's rankings based on ideological proximity

cg: Sure, here's an updated Python class that generates N politicians and M voters on a 2-dimensional political spectrum and determines each voter's rankings based on ideological proximity:

```
import random

class Politician:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

class Voter:
    def __init__(self, x, y, num_candidates, candidates):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
        self.preferences = self.generate_preferences(num_candidates, candidates)

    def generate_preferences(self, num_candidates, candidates):
        # Calculate each candidate's distance from the voter in the 2-dimensional political spectrum
        distances = [(candidate, ((self.x - candidate.x) ** 2 + (self.y - candidate.y) ** 2) ** 0.5) for candidate in candidates]

        # Sort the candidates by their distance from the voter
        candidates_sorted = sorted(distances, key=lambda c: c[1])

        # Assign a preference ranking to each candidate based on their distance from the voter
        preferences = {}
        for i, (candidate, distance) in enumerate(candidates_sorted):
            rank = i + 1
            preferences[candidate] = rank

        return preferences

class PoliticalSpectrum:
    def __init__(self, num_candidates, num_voters):
        self.num_candidates = num_candidates
        self.num_voters = num_voters
        self.candidates = self.generate_candidates()
        self.voters = self.generate_voters()

    def generate_candidates(self):
        # Generate N candidates with random x and y coordinates in the 2-dimensional political spectrum
        candidates = []
        for i in range(self.num_candidates):
            x = random.uniform(-1, 1)
            y = random.uniform(-1, 1)
            candidates.append(Politician(x, y))

        return candidates

    def generate_voters(self):
        # Generate M voters with random x and y coordinates in the 2-dimensional political spectrum
        voters = []
        for i in range(self.num_voters):
            x = random.uniform(-1, 1)
            y = random.uniform(-1, 1)
            voter = Voter(x, y, self.num_candidates, self.candidates)
            voters.append(voter)

        return voters

```

cg: This class defines three classes: Politician, Voter, and PoliticalSpectrum. Politician represents a political candidate with x and y coordinates on the 2-dimensional political spectrum. Voter represents a voter with x and y coordinates on the same spectrum, and a preferences attribute that stores the voter's ranked preferences for the politicians based on ideological proximity. PoliticalSpectrum generates N politicians and M voters on the 2-dimensional political spectrum and stores them in self.candidates and self.voters attributes, respectively.

cg: To use the class, you can create a new PoliticalSpectrum instance with the desired number of candidates and voters:

```
spectrum = PoliticalSpectrum(num_candidates=5, num_voters=10)
```

This will generate 5 candidates and 10 voters on the 2-dimensional political spectrum, and calculate each voter's ranked preferences based on ideological proximity. You can access the candidates and voters using the spectrum.candidates and spectrum.voters attributes, respectively.

For example, to print each voter's preferences for the candidates:

```
for voter in spectrum.voters:
    print("Voter at ({}, {}) preferences:".format(voter.x, voter.y))
    for candidate, rank in voter.preferences.items():
        print("Candidate at ({}, {}) ranked #{}".format(candidate.x, candidate.y)
```

mw: can you create a python class that tabulates a winner of the ranked choice voting election based on the voter preferences from spectrum class above?

cg: Sure, here's an example implementation of a RankedChoiceVoting class in Python that takes in the preferences generated by the Spectrum class and tabulates a winner using the ranked choice voting method:

```
python

class RankedChoiceVoting:
    def __init__(self, num_candidates, num_voters, candidate_spectrum, voter_spectrum):
        self.num_candidates = num_candidates
        self.num_voters = num_voters
        self.candidate_spectrum = candidate_spectrum
        self.voter_spectrum = voter_spectrum
        self.votes = []

    def generate_votes(self):
        for i in range(self.num_voters):
            voter = self.voter_spectrum[i]
            voter_preferences = sorted(range(self.num_candidates), key=lambda x: self.candidate_spectrum[x].distance(voter))
            self.votes.append(voter_preferences)

    def tabulate(self):
        candidates = list(range(self.num_candidates))
        while len(candidates) > 1:
            votes_for_candidates = {c: 0 for c in candidates}
            for vote in self.votes:
                for c in vote:
                    if c in candidates:
                        votes_for_candidates[c] += 1
                        break
            least_votes_candidate = min(candidates, key=lambda c: votes_for_candidates[c])
            candidates.remove(least_votes_candidate)

        return candidates[0]
```

cg: To use this class, you would first generate the candidate_spectrum and voter_spectrum using the Spectrum class, and then create an instance of RankedChoiceVoting with the appropriate parameters:

```
num_candidates = 5
num_voters = 100
candidate_spectrum = Spectrum(num_candidates, 2)
voter_spectrum = Spectrum(num_voters, 2)
rcv = RankedChoiceVoting(num_candidates, num_voters, candidate_spectrum, voter_spectrum)
```

cg: Next, you would generate the votes using the generate_votes method:

```
rcv.generate_votes()
```

cg: Finally, you can tabulate the winner of the election using the tabulate method:

```
python

winner = rcv.tabulate()
print("Winner:", winner)
```

cg: This will output the winner of the election based on the ranked choice voting method.

mw: can you now create a class that polls a subset of the voters on their first choice preferences?

cg: Sure! Here's an updated implementation of the RankedChoiceVoting class that allows for polling a subset of voters on their first choice preferences:

```
python

class RankedChoiceVoting:
    def __init__(self, num_candidates, num_voters, candidate_spectrum, voter_spectrum):
        self.num_candidates = num_candidates
        self.num_voters = num_voters
        self.candidate_spectrum = candidate_spectrum
        self.voter_spectrum = voter_spectrum
        self.votes = []
        self.first_choice_votes = {}

    def generate_votes(self):
        for i in range(self.num_voters):
            voter = self.voter_spectrum[i]
            voter_preferences = sorted(range(self.num_candidates), key=lambda x: self.candidate_spectrum[x].distance(voter))
            self.votes.append(voter_preferences)
            
            # Track first choice votes
            if i in self.first_choice_votes:
                self.first_choice_votes[i].append(voter_preferences[0])
            else:
                self.first_choice_votes[i] = [voter_preferences[0]]

    def tabulate(self):
        candidates = list(range(self.num_candidates))
        while len(candidates) > 1:
            votes_for_candidates = {c: 0 for c in candidates}
            for vote in self.votes:
                for c in vote:
                    if c in candidates:
                        votes_for_candidates[c] += 1
                        break
            least_votes_candidate = min(candidates, key=lambda c: votes_for_candidates[c])
            candidates.remove(least_votes_candidate)

        return candidates[0]

    def poll_first_choice(self, num_voters):
        first_choice_counts = {c: 0 for c in range(self.num_candidates)}
        for i in range(num_voters):
            if i not in self.first_choice_votes:
                break
            first_choice_counts[self.first_choice_votes[i][0]] += 1
        return sorted(range(self.num_candidates), key=lambda c: first_choice_counts[c], reverse=True)
```

cg: The new method poll_first_choice takes in the number of voters to poll on their first choice preferences, and returns a list of the candidates in order of the number of first choice votes they received.

cg: Here's an example usage of this class:

```
python

num_candidates = 5
num_voters = 100
candidate_spectrum = Spectrum(num_candidates, 2)
voter_spectrum = Spectrum(num_voters, 2)
rcv = RankedChoiceVoting(num_candidates, num_voters, candidate_spectrum, voter_spectrum)

# Generate votes
rcv.generate_votes()

# Tabulate the winner
winner = rcv.tabulate()
print("Winner:", winner)

# Poll the first choice preferences of 30 voters
first_choice_results = rcv.poll_first_choice(30)
print("First choice results:", first_choice_results)
```

cg: In this example, we generate the votes using the generate_votes method, and then tabulate the winner using the tabulate method. We also poll the first choice preferences of 30 voters using the poll_first_choice method, and print out the results.

mw: I would like to figure out a way to code for the voters changing their rankings, based on the result of the polling. What would be some reasons for the voters to change their rankings strategically?

cg: Voters might change their rankings strategically for a few reasons, such as:

* Tactical Voting: Voters might strategically vote for their second or third choice candidate instead of their first choice candidate in order to prevent another candidate they dislike from winning.

* Preference Change: Voters might change their rankings based on new information they receive about the candidates, or they might simply change their minds over time.

* Candidate Dropout: If a voter's preferred candidate drops out of the race, they may need to change their rankings to reflect their new preferences.

* Coalition Building: Voters might change their rankings in order to help a candidate they support form a coalition with other candidates in order to win.

To account for these reasons, you could add methods to your existing class that allow voters to update their rankings based on new information or candidate dropout, and also allow for polling of voter preferences to simulate strategic voting.


mw: can you modify voter preferences for a candidate to be based on the candidates proximity on the 2d ideological scale but also dependent on an arbitrary parameter corresponding to their estimate of the of that candidate beating their least favorite choice?

cg: Yes, you could modify the voter preferences to incorporate an arbitrary parameter that represents the voter's estimate of a candidate's ability to beat their least favorite choice. One way to do this is to introduce a "strategic factor" into the voter preference calculation, where the closer a candidate is ideologically to the voter and the higher their strategic factor, the more likely they are to be ranked higher by the voter.

cg: Here's an example implementation of this idea:

```
class Voter:
    def __init__(self, x, y, strategic_factor):
        self.x = x # x-coordinate on ideological spectrum
        self.y = y # y-coordinate on ideological spectrum
        self.strategic_factor = strategic_factor # estimate of candidate's ability to beat least favorite choice
        self.rankings = [] # list to store candidate rankings
    
    def calculate_preference(self, candidate):
        # calculate distance between voter and candidate on ideological spectrum
        dist = ((self.x - candidate.x)**2 + (self.y - candidate.y)**2)**0.5
        
        # calculate preference score based on distance and strategic factor
        preference = (1 - dist) * self.strategic_factor
        
        return preference

    def update_rankings(self, candidates):
        # calculate preference scores for all candidates
        preference_scores = [(candidate, self.calculate_preference(candidate)) for candidate in candidates]
        
        # sort candidates by preference score
        sorted_candidates = sorted(preference_scores, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
        
        # update rankings based on sorted order
        self.rankings = [candidate for candidate, preference_score in sorted_candidates]
```

cg: In this implementation, the strategic_factor is a parameter that the voter supplies, and it represents their estimate of a candidate's ability to beat their least favorite choice. The calculate_preference method calculates a preference score based on the distance between the voter and the candidate on the ideological spectrum, as well as the strategic factor. The update_rankings method calculates preference scores for all candidates and sorts them in descending order, updating the voter's rankings based on the sorted order.

mw: I need define the strategic factor in a way that there is a value for each possible candidate

cg: Sure! In that case, you could define the strategic factor as a dictionary that maps each candidate to a corresponding strategic factor value. Here's an example implementation that includes this modification:

```
class Voter:
    def __init__(self, x, y, strategic_factors):
        self.x = x # x-coordinate on ideological spectrum
        self.y = y # y-coordinate on ideological spectrum
        self.strategic_factors = strategic_factors # strategic factors for all candidates
        self.rankings = [] # list to store candidate rankings
    
    def calculate_preference(self, candidate):
        # calculate distance between voter and candidate on ideological spectrum
        dist = ((self.x - candidate.x)**2 + (self.y - candidate.y)**2)**0.5
        
        # get strategic factor for this candidate
        strategic_factor = self.strategic_factors[candidate]
        
        # calculate preference score based on distance and strategic factor
        preference = (1 - dist) * strategic_factor
        
        return preference

    def update_rankings(self, candidates):
        # calculate preference scores for all candidates
        preference_scores = [(candidate, self.calculate_preference(candidate)) for candidate in candidates]
        
        # sort candidates by preference score
        sorted_candidates = sorted(preference_scores, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
        
        # update rankings based on sorted order
        self.rankings = [candidate for candidate, preference_score in sorted_candidates]
```

cg: In this implementation, the strategic_factors parameter is a dictionary that maps each candidate to their corresponding strategic factor value. The calculate_preference method looks up the strategic factor for the given candidate and calculates the preference score based on the distance and strategic factor. The update_rankings method remains the same as in the previous implementation.

mw: what value would the strategic factor need to be, if the voter is ranking purely on ideological proximity?

cg: If the voter is ranking purely on ideological proximity and not considering any strategic factors, then the strategic factor for all candidates should be 1. This would mean that the voter's preference for each candidate is solely based on their distance on the ideological spectrum, without any additional considerations.

cg: In the implementation I provided earlier, you could set the strategic_factors parameter to a dictionary where all candidates map to a value of 1, like so:

```
python

strategic_factors = {candidate: 1 for candidate in candidates}
voter = Voter(x, y, strategic_factors)
```

cg: This would result in the calculate_preference method only considering the distance between the voter and candidate, and not any additional strategic factors.

mw: can you write a function that revises the voter's strategic factors based on the results of the results of the poll_first_choice function?

cg: Certainly! Here's an example function that updates the strategic factors of a Voter object based on the results of a first-choice poll:

```
def update_strategic_factors(voter, poll_results):
    """Updates the strategic factors of a Voter object based on the results of a first-choice poll.

    Args:
        voter (Voter): The Voter object to update.
        poll_results (dict): A dictionary where the keys are the candidates in the election and the values are the
                             number of first-choice votes each candidate received in the poll.

    Returns:
        None
    """
    # Get the least-favorite candidate of the voter
    least_favorite = voter.calculate_preference(voter.x, voter.y, voter.candidates)[-1]

    # Calculate the likelihood of each candidate beating the least-favorite candidate, based on the poll results
    total_votes = sum(poll_results.values())
    likelihoods = {candidate: 1 - (poll_results.get(least_favorite, 0) / total_votes)
                   if candidate != least_favorite else 0
                   for candidate in voter.candidates}

    # Normalize the likelihoods to sum to 1
    total_likelihood = sum(likelihoods.values())
    if total_likelihood != 0:
        likelihoods = {candidate: likelihood / total_likelihood for candidate, likelihood in likelihoods.items()}

    # Update the voter's strategic factors based on the likelihoods
    voter.strategic_factors = likelihoods
    ```
    
cg: This function takes a Voter object and a dictionary of poll results as input, and updates the voter's strategic_factors attribute based on the likelihood of each candidate beating the voter's least-favorite candidate. The least_favorite variable is calculated by calling the calculate_preference method on the voter with their own coordinates as input, and taking the last candidate in the resulting list.

cg: The likelihood of each candidate beating the least-favorite candidate is calculated by subtracting the percentage of votes the least-favorite candidate received in the poll from 1. If the candidate is the least-favorite, their likelihood is set to 0. These likelihoods are then normalized to sum to 1, and used to update the voter's strategic_factors attribute.

mw: can you also write a function that adjusts the politicians positions on the political axis based on the results of the poll_first_choice function, assuming candidates are trying to maximize their chances of winning the first round

cg: Certainly! Here's a possible implementation:

```
